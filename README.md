# Bubble_Lua_Libraries

Libs in Lua I will need for Bubble.
Basically these libraries are all just created to be used by Bubble.
You can install them were you want, as the builders I use can easily be scripted to pick these up as they may be required or not.

At the beginning only a small number of libs may live here (and in the very beginning even none at all), of course the number will grow.
